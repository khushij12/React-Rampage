Understanding React Components: A Deep Dive

## Getting Started with React: Tools and Setup
### What is react?
- React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. 
- It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. 
-  React allows developers to create reusable UI components and build complex UIs through a declarative programming. 
-   It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to render changes to the UI, which makes it fast and efficient.
    - In web development, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like model. 
    - The Virtual DOM is a concept used in the React library, which is an abstract representation of the DOM, a lightweight copy of it.
